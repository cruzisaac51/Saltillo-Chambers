            SET IN A SMALL WATERFALL
            The indigenous people who inhabited this area did not have fixed populations nor did they sow the land. His life was organized around hunting and gathering wild fruits.

            The Saltillo Valley was covered with vegetation; from the mountains, throughout the land, there were swamps and numerous springs. This wide extension at certain times was populated by flecheros Indians who fed on seeds, hunted wild boars, deer and guajolotes, as well as fish and turtles.

            After the conquest, the Spaniards saw in the Saltillo Valley a propitious place to found a population. This territory corresponded to the kingdom of Nueva Vizcaya, whose capital was Durango. Saltillo was founded before 1574, according to a report made by the royal choreographer to Philip II, there appears the name of Saltillo at the end of a list of populations founded in those years. The name was Villa de Santiago del Saltillo. However, the official date of the founding of the city is the year 1577.

            The European conquerors found that a small waterfall gushed from between the rocks of a hill, located south of the city. As that waterfall was rather a "Saltillo", with this name they baptized the town.
